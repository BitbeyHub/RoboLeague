Features:
    - Ball trail
    - Braking
    - Ackermann steering / bicycle model
    - lateral friction model as in RL (ratio between Vx/Vy)
    - Sticky forces
    - Stabilizing moment (if 2 wheels touch ground, calculate the ground normal and apply moment so that the dot/cross product is 0)
    - Dodges and second jump
    - Better drift (maybe apply torque or less drag on rear wheels)
    - Ball car interaction (power hit depended on the distance from CoM etc)
    - Input manager and profiles for PS4 controller (maybe controller auto detect OR use the new input system)

Problems:

    - lateral speed goes behind the wheels
    - Camera fixes (maybe use Cinemamachine, camera as in Kart game)
    - Aerial CoM
    - Breakdancing (sphere collider touches the ground but not the raycast, enables aircontrol on the ground)

Low priority:
    - Goal explosion and net visual effect
    - Sounds
    - Car hit sparks
    - Replace interpolation if else madness for throttle and turn radius with animation curves :)
 
Done:
    - Auto SHIFT click on the body in the scene view
    - Lateral friction force on walls
