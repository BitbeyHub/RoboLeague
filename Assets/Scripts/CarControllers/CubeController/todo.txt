Features:
    - Ball trail
    - Sounds
    - Car hit sparks
    - Ackermann steering with bicycle model
    - lateral friction model as in RL (ratio between Vx/Vy)
    - Sticky forces
    - Dodges and second jump
    - Better drift (maybe apply torque or less drag on rear wheels)
    - Ball car interaction (power hit depended on the distance from CoM etc)
    - Input manager and profiles for PS4 controller (maybe controller auto detect)
    - Braking
    - Auto SHIFT click on the body in the scene view
    
Problems:
    - Lateral friction force on walls 
    - lateral speed goes behind the wheels
    - Camera fixes (maybe use Cinemamachine, camera as in Kart game)
    - Aerial CoM

Low priority:
    - Goal explosion and net visual effect
