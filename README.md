# RoboLeague
A car soccer environment inspired by Rocket League for deep reinforcement learning experiments in an adversarial self-play setting.

### Installation:
Please refer to [Unity ML Agents repository.](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents) Current version of RoboLeague uses [ML-Agents Release 11](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/releases/tag/release_11)

### Completed features (identical to Rocket League):
* Ball physics
* Car aerial control and physics
* Acceleration and braking
* Single jump
* Sticky forces

### Planned features:
* Unity ML agents integration
* OpenAI gym interface integration. [Unity ML already provides a wrapper](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/tree/master/gym-unity)
* Car ball interaction
* Dodges and second jump
* Stabilizing moment near the ground
* lateral friction model as in the game (ratio between Vx/Vy)
